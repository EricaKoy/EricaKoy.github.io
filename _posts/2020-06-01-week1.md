# Week 4 (Jun 26 - Jul 2)
- Reproduced NeuroSEED benchmarks from [Chlenski 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841)
using HyperDT and anndata objects
- Collected datasets from Linear Classifiers paper [Tabaghi 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10204) and 
converted to anndata objects
- Edited the project website based on my advisor's feedback

# Week 3 (Jun 19 - Jun 25)
- Finished the Udemy course. After the Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) 
refresher...
  - Reviewed chapters 1 and 2 of [ML textbook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
  - Reviewed the [HyperDT tutorial](https://github.com/pchlenski/hyperdt/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) 
  - Reread [Chlenski 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841) to supplement the HyperDT tutorial

# Week 2 (Jun 12 - Jun 18)
- Completed half of the "Python for Machine Learning & Data Science" Udemy course
- Created an initial draft of my project website 
- Looked over the [HyperDT tutorial](https://github.com/pchlenski/hyperdt/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) 
based on [Chlenski 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841)

# Week 1 (Jun 5 - Jun 11)
- Met with my advisor, discussed the scope of my project
- Read papers on HyperDT [(Chlenski 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841)
and Mixed Curvature Decision Tree (in the workings)
  - Listed potential biological datasets that could be used with HyperDT
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of [ML textbook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
