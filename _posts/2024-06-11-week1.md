title: Week 1 (Jun 5 - Jun 11)
---

I met with my advisor, Dr. Pe'er, via Zoom. Before our meeting, he assigned me a paper to read on the hyperbolic classifier, HyperDT, which will be the topic of study this summer [(Chlenski 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841). During the meeting, we reviewed the paper, and I had the chance to ask clarifying questions. We also discussed the scope of my project: I will embed real-life biological datasets using HyperDT, focusing on how well HyperDT preserves embedding distances. I also met with Philippe, the PhD candidate who made HyperDT, and will be collaborating closely with him throughout the summer. We discussed the main objectives of the project in further detail: 

1. compare hyperbolic and Euclidean classifiers ability to preserve embedding distances 
2. identify data properties that lead to higher performance with hyperbolic models, particularly data that can be represented as trees, such as genetics and heredity
3. create a comprehensive table detailing the various approaches we try and their corresponding performance

After my meeting with Philippe, I brainstormed potential biological datasets to use with HyperDT and read chapters 1 and 2 of the [ML textbook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).
