title: Week 3 (Jun 19 - Jun 25)
---

I completed the latter half of the 44-hour "Python for Machine Learning & Data Science" course on Udemy. After refreshing my skills in Python (covering pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn), I reviewed the code in chapters 1 and 2 of the [ML textbook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). I also revisited the [HyperDT tutorial](https://github.com/pchlenski/hyperdt/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) and [Chlenski 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841), focusing on the methods section to supplement the HyperDT tutorial. 

At the end of the week, I met with Philippe, where he advised me to learn computational biology data structure packages, particularly Anndata, as the biological dataset I will be working with is stored as an Anndata object. He explained that Anndata is typically used for single-cell data, with X as a matrix of counts, var and obs as pandas dataframes for column and row-level metadata (such as gene and cell information), and other components like varm, obsm, varp, and obsp, which are matrices for associating variables or calculating pairwise distances. These structures essentially help glue numpy matrices and dataframes together to keep data organized and indexed.
