title: Week 4 (Jun 26 - Jul 2)
---

This week, I completed the initial draft of my project website. After sending the draft to my advisor, I incorporated their feedback on the "About my Project" section and made the necessary revisions. The website was then successfully submitted to DREAM, and I completed the second milestone for the program.

On the technical side, I received access to the Aeolus server, which the lab uses to store data and work on projects. I tested the SSH connection, set up my computing environment according to my preferences, and configured VSC with the SSH extension. After setting up, I worked on reproducing the NeuroSEED benchmarks from [Chlenski 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841) using HyperDT and Anndata objects. I also collected datasets 1-3 used in the Linear Classifiers paper, [Tabaghi 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10204) and converted them to Anndata objects to potentially embed them using HyperDT at a later time.
