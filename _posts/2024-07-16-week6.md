title: Week 6 (Jul 10 - Jul 16)
---
This week, I moved on from working with the NeuroSEED data and began analyzing the polblogs and AmericanGut datasets using the same code framework I used to replicate the NeuroSEED data. The polblogs dataset represents interactions within a political blog network, while the AmericanGut dataset contains microbiome data on gut bacterial communities from different individuals. I created code to calculate the pairwise Euclidean distances, k-NN graph distances, and Weighted UniFrac distances for both datasets. These three distance were calculated as they may be used to generate embeddings of the datasets. 

I also familiarized myself with the embedders library that Philippe had already created and successfully reproduced the benchmark results for the polblogs dataset, which used pairwise distances, as outlined in the notebook. After replicating the data, I generating embeddings for the k-NN distance matrix.

At the end of the week, I met with Philippe, and he gave me some tips on finding the UniFrac distance, whcih I was having trouble calculating. He also reviewed my k-NN distance code and found that some revisions had to be made, which I will cover in further detail in next week's post.
