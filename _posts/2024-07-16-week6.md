title: Week 6 (Jul 10 - Jul 16)
---
This week, I moved on from working on the NeuroSEED data and started analyzing the polblogs and americangut datasets. The polblogs dataset represents blog interactions within a political network, while the AmericanGut dataset contains microbiome data on gut bacterial communities in different individuals. I created code to find the pairwise Euclidiean, k-NN graph, and Weight UniFrac distances for both datasets. 

Building on this, I familiarized myself with the embedders library that Philippe had created and successfully reproduced the benchmark results for the polblogs dataset, which used pairwise distances, as outlined in the notebook. After replicating the data, I generating embeddings for the remaining two distances matrices, k-NN and Weighted UniFrac. 

At the end of the week, I met with Philippe, and he gave me some tips on finding the UniFrac distance, whcih I was having toruble with. He also reviewed my k-NN distance code and found that some revisions had to be made, which I will cover in further detail in next week's post.
