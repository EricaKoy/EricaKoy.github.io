title: Week 7 (Jul 17 - Jul 23)
---
This week, I fixed a mistake in calculating k-NN distances. My previous code calculated the distances of the k nearest neighbors and used these distances to generate embeddings. However, the correct approach is to calculate the distances between all points using the k-NN distances. I revised my code to build the k-NN graph with the distances between the k nearest neighbors and computed the shortest distances for all points, resulting in an n by n matrix that captures the shortest path through the points.

I also worked on finding UniFrac distances using Philippeâ€™s aggregate_tree function, which will aid in analyzing the microbial community data.

At the end of the week, I met with Philippe, who provided some recommendations. He suggested implementing multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a variant of PCA for the polblogs dataset. Additionally, he recommended exploring Isomap to better capture the manifold structure of the dataset.
