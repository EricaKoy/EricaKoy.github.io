title: Week 8 (Jul 24 - Jul 30)

This week, I updated the k-NN graph function by calculating and printing the size of the top connected component and modified the downsampling code to drop any taxa where the entire column contains zeros to reduce calculation time. 

I also spent time familiarizing myself with the polblogs notebook that Philippe had used for his paper, getting a clear understanding of the inputs, outputs, and general workflow. I experimented with the hyperparameters of the embedding system, such as learning rate and burn-in time, and explored how different signatures affect the results. Interestingly, the choice of signature didn’t seem to have as much influence on the final loss or D_avg score as expected, which is something I plan to investigate further.

To wrap things up, I wrote a loop to generate embeddings over 5 different seeds, ran hyperDT with 5-fold cross-validation, and reported the scores. This standard benchmarking approach, similar to the one in the hyperDT paper, forms the foundation for our biological dataset benchmarking. I also delved into the Zachary’s Karate Club dataset, which will help with future social network analyses.
