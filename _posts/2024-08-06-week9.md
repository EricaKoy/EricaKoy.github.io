title: Week 9 (Jul 31 - Aug 6)
---
This week, I continued working on generating polblog embeddings. I experimented with different parameters and analysed their effects on D average (the distortion between the original distance and the calculated distance), hyperDT accuracy, and DT accuracy. I adjusted the range of signatures (-2 to 2) to capture a denser range of D average, varied the seeds, and tweaked hyperparameters to see their influence. I also extended the algorithm's runtime, since Philippe noted that while the loss function may appear to converge quickly at shorter runtimes, the underlying structure can still be poorly defined. 

For visualization, I generated scatter plots for a single manifold, plotting D average against the difference between hyperDT and DT scores, aiming to identify any inverse correlation. Additionally, I plotted curvature versus D average and curvature versus the difference in scores, coloring the plots by curvature. These plots helped in finding the optimal curvature where D average reaches its minimum.Longer training and testing iterations led the D-average to decrease. With some seeds, we saw hyperbolic signatures to have higher accuracy when using HyperDT then scikit-learn and vice versa for spherical signatures. However, it seemed like the particular seed we used had a large impact on the relationship between curvature, D average, hyperDT accuracy, and DT accuracy.
