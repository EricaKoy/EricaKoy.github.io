title: Week 10 (Aug 7 - Aug 13)
---

This week, I moved on to generating embeddings for the AmericanGut dataset using the pipeline used to generate the polblogs embeddings. The AmericanGut dataset is significantly larger than the polblogs dataset, so I had to create a sample of the dataset, where the ratio of ibd to non-ibd is 1:1, to ensure that the calculations did not take too long. When generating polblogs embeddings last week, I learned that the seed can have a large influence on the D average, hyperDT score, and DT score. Therefore, to generate the AmericanGut embeddings, I ran several benchmarks with different seeds and computed the average values to make sure that the relationships that I saw was not due to the particular seed. 

At the end of the week, Philippe suggested that I create boxplots to visualize the various relationships. I will work on this next week. I had visualized the data using scatterplots during the meeting, but it was very messy and hard to read.
