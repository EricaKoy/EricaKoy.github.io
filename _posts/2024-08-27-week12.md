Look at nearest neighbor graph, distance matrixes
Cluster maps for nearest neighbor graph

Aitchison distance graph 

Cluster map the pairwise distances (1line, seaborn.clustermap)
2 dimension embedders

Dim 2 for embeddings, then convert 
Polar coord  for + curvature
Poincare disk for - curvature 
Then plot in 2d

Why our classifiers are not puling anything… something wrong with our dataset, not learning distance??? Or metadata var not working very well???



Pairwise distance for embedding

Mixed curvature autoencoder

Find pairwise distances, then do embeddings, convert to polar and poincare, plot
Use same seed, 5000 iterations 
Figure out what stripes mean 
Color by metadata 
Obs: use “ibd” first, save picture 
Can email philippe for recs
