To better understand why hyperDT and DT are not classifying the data well, I created 2 dimention embeddings and converted them into polar coordinates for positive curvatures and Poincare disk coordinates for negative curvature. I then plotted the embeddings for each curvature in 2d. 

I saw that for different seeds, the generated visuals looked drastically different. However, there were some similarities, such as the stripes in the data for curvatures -2 to 0. For positive curvature, the embeddings seemed to be "sucked in," and gradually change from a striped circle to a line. 

To determine if the stripes were due to a lack of training iterations, I changed the total number of iterations from 1000 to 5000. The stripes for larger iterations were more defined and change from a circle to a triangular/line shape was also more defined for larger iterations. 

Next, to determine the meaning of the stripes, I colored the graphs with metadata in the anndata obs matrix.
