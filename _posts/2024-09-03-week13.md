title: Week 13 (Aug 28 - Sept 3)
---
This week, I worked to determine if any one of the metadata was causing the stripes seen last week. I created code that iterated through ~400 metadata columns and computed each metadata's inter vs intra distance ratio. Our intuition was that metadata with larger effects on the data geometry would have lower ratios, while those with minimal effects would have a ratio closer to 1. I could not find any metadata columns with significant effects.

I also started to work on my final paper and am finalizing my website.
