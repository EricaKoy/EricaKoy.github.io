## About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is [Erica Koyama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericakoyama/), and I am currently 
pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at Columbia University, 
with an expected graduation date of December 2025. 

I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and a concentration in the life sciences from 
Soka University of America in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in cell 
biology and drug design research, where I discovered the significant impact computer science 
can have on accelerating wet lab research. This realization motivated me to enroll in the 
CS@CU MS Bridge Program at Columbia University, designed to help students from 
non-CS backgrounds transition into the field of computer science.

As I prepare to begin my Master’s program this fall, I'm excited to participate in the 
Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program this summer. 
This program offers me the opportunity to gain valuable 
research experience and technical expertise in machine learning, helping me bridge my 
past experiences with my future career goals.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to sharing my journey and insights with you!

## About My Project

Hyperbolic geometry overcomes the limitations of Euclidean space in capturing distance arrangements with 
exponentially growing neighborhood sizes. This characteristic is particularly evident in biological data, 
such as phylogenetic trees and other branching lineages, making hyperbolic geometry essential for accurately 
representing these data types.

However, existing hyperbolic classification and regression methods face significant limitations, 
often being numerically unstable or computationally inefficient. The use of preferred machine learning algorithms 
is often compromised when prioritizing accurate hyperbolic distance representations. HyperDT addresses these 
challenges by providing an accurate, efficient, and hyperbolically appropriate version of decision trees and 
random forests for classification and regression tasks [(Chlenski 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841). 
**This summer, I classified biological datasets using HyperDT and competing classifiers and sought to understand
the circumstances where HyperDT is most appropriate for use.**
