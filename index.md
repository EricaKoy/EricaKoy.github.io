## About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is [Erica Koyama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericakoyama/), and I am currently 
pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at Columbia University, 
with an expected graduation date of December 2025. 

I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and a concentration in the life sciences from 
Soka University of America in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in cell 
biology and drug design research, where I discovered the significant impact computer science 
can have on accelerating wet lab research. This realization motivated me to enroll in the 
CS@CU MS Bridge Program at Columbia University, designed to help students from 
non-CS backgrounds transition into the field of computer science.

As I prepare to begin my Master’s program this fall, I'm excited to participate in the 
Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program this summer. 
This program offers me the opportunity to gain valuable 
research experience and technical expertise in machine learning, helping me bridge my 
past experiences with my future career goals.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to sharing my journey and insights with you!

## About My Project

Hyperbolic embeddings can capture hierarchical structures in data, making them ideal for tasks involving latent hierarchies. However, existing hyperbolic classification and regression methods, while advantageous in this respect, often face challenges such as numerical instability and computational inefficiency. HyperDT addresses these issues by leveraging hyperbolic geometry in decision trees using inner products, improving stability and scalability [(Chlenski 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841). Despite these advantages, HyperDT has not been tested on real datasets, and hyperbolic methods, in general, remain underexplored in the context of metagenomics. We applied HyperDT to the American Gut Dataset and observed that while the dataset exhibited latent hierarchical structure, this did not translate into improved performance for HyperDT. Instead, traditional Euclidean-based methods demonstrated comparable accuracy in predictive power to HyperDT.
