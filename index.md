## About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is [Erica Koyama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericakoyama/), and I am currently 
pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at Columbia University, 
with an expected graduation of December 2025. 

I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and a concentration in the life sciences from 
Soka University of America in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in cell 
biology and drug design research, where I discovered the significant impact computer science 
can have on accelerating wet lab research. This realization motivated me to enroll in the 
CS@CU MS Bridge Program at Columbia University, designed to help students from 
non-CS backgrounds transition into the field of computer science.

As I prepare to begin my Master’s program next fall, I'm excited to participate in the 
Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program this summer. 
This program offers me the opportunity to gain valuable 
research experience and technical expertise in machine learning, helping me bridge my 
past experiences with my future career goals.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to sharing my journey and insights with you!

## About My Project

A description of your research project and goals (as outlined by you and your advisor at the beginning 
of your project).

Hyperbolic geometry captures hierarchically structured data efficiently and has numerous applications in classifying real-world data. However, hyperbolic classifiers face high computational demands due to Riemannian manifold computations, making them difficult to scale. HYPERDT is a novel hyperbolic decision tree algorithm that utilizes inner products to transform Euclidian decision trees into hyperbolic space, eliminating the need for computationally challenging operations [(Chlenski 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13841). This summer, I classified various datasets using HYPERDT and Euclidian classifiers and determined the types of datasets that each best classifies.
